# ts2uml README

Whether you're a developer visualizing relationships in complex TypeScript projects or an architect documenting system designs, `ts2uml` provides an intuitive, integrated solution.

## Features

### 1. TypeScript to UML Conversion
Effortlessly parse your TypeScript files and convert them into detailed UML diagrams. Visualize classes, interfaces, and relationships directly within your editor.

### 2. Interactive Diagram Generation
Harness the power of **D3.js** to generate dynamic, interactive diagrams that bring your TypeScript structures to life.

### 3. Seamless VS Code Integration
Run commands, view diagrams, and export visualizations without leaving your coding environment.
